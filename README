3.Installation
==============
There is no real installation. Simply extract all the files into a folder.
If you want to have a desktop icon, right-click the file called XbmcOniMon.exe
and choose "Send to" --> "Desktop". 

4. Preparations
===============
Before you start "XBMC on iMON Display" you need to make some configurations.

General
-------
Make sure no other running software on your computer is using TCP port 9090.
You can do that by using NMap (http://nmap.org/) to scan the port and see if
it is currently used. Unfortunately this port is currently hardcoded within
XBMC and therefore can't be changed.

iMON Manager
------------
Open iMON Manager and go to "Options" --> "Plug-in Mode" and activate the "Use 
Display Plug-in Mode" checkbox. Then go to "iMON Utilities" --> "FrontView" and 
make sure "Run FrontView When iMON Starts" is either set to "Always" or 
"Automatically".
Now go to "iMON Utilities" --> "FrontView" and open the "Media Information" tab.
Here you need to disable the "XBMC" option under "Available Player".
Also make sure that iMON Manager is running when you start "XBMC on iMON Display".

XBMC
----
Open XBMC and go into "Settings" --> "Network" --> "Services". Activate the option
"Allow control of XBMC via HTTP" and enter a Port (Username and Password are optional).

5. Usage
========
Start "XBMC on iMON Display" simply by double-clicking the XbmcOniMon.exe.
A window will open up which consists of a menu bar (allowing to manually
connect/disconnect with/from XBMC and initialize/uninitialize the iMON
Display API), a navigation (General, iMON, XBMC) and options. All the options
should be self-explaining. Simply click one of the three option areas in the
navigation to see their specific options. Changing an option immediatelly 
affects the way "XBMC on iMON Display" behaves.

Make sure you provide the correct information to be able to connect with XBMC.

6. Known Issues
===============
Here is a list of a few known issues. Please DO NOT report these as bugs!
 - The iMON Display stays dark after initialization when it is deactivated in
   iMON Manager
 - The progress bar does not adjust correctly when Fast Forwarding / Rewinding
 - The display freezes for a short time when pressing a button on a remote
